### Scripts used here 

1. ```gaussian_noise.py``` : This adds gaussian noise to the image.

2. ```horizontal_flip``` : Flips the image horizontally. This can also be done in ```Keras``` which creates augmented images internally. So we would not be using this script to generate more images.

3. ```recursive_noise.py``` : This adds the noise to the images.

4. ```recursive_rotate_image.py``` : This rotates the image by 5 degreee in both clockwise and anti-clockwise direction.
